Hello! I'm a data scientist and i love to learn and build data science/machine learning products. I graduated Cornell University in 2019 with a B.A in Physics with a minor in Computer Science. I first started out in Physics/Astronomy research, but then discovered my love of data/Machine learning and have since switched. I have worked on many different data science projects including automation, data visualization, insights, and machine learning, and data engineering. Currently, I work at JPMorgan building data products to help deliver actionable insights for our bankers, so they can better serve their clients.
